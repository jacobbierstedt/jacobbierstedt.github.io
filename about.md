My name is Jacob Bierstedt, a software engineer and bioinformatics scientist currently working at Mayo Clinic.
I previously worked at IDbyDNA, Illumina, and Phenomix Sciences where I worked on projects ranging from 
NGS-based detection of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance to obesity endotype classification.

My current interests include secondary analysis of sequencing data, metagenomics, environmental genomics, and 
population genomics.

At the time of writing, I am living in Minnesota and spending my free time in nature.
