My name is Jacob Bierstedt, a software engineer and bioinformatics scientist currently working at Mayo Clinic.
I previously worked at IDbyDNA, Illumina, and Phenomix Sciences where I worked on projects ranging from 
NGS-based detection of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance to obesity endotype classification.
